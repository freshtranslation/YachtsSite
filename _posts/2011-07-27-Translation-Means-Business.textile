With the boom of Globalization, companies across the globe started seeking out new methods to maximize their sales. 
Recent research by the European Commission indicates that *82%* of consumers were less likely to buy goods online if the website was not in their native *language*. So if a *French* student visits your website and reads a product description in *French*, he is much more likely to buy the product.

When it comes to the Global market, research by the Common Sense Advisory proves that consumers are more likely to buy a product that contains information in their own language. 

Statistics indicate that enterprises that *translate* their  websites and promotional material tend to be easily reached by global visitors and potential buyers. Regardless of the type of organization we are working within, it seems that there is a need to think globally. 

And we couldn't agree more!
